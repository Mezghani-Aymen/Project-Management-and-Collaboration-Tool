# Idea: Project Management and Collaboration Tool

### Description

Develop a project management and collaboration tool designed for remote teams. The application will include features such as task management, real-time chat, file sharing, and project tracking. This tool will be robust enough to handle various user roles (admin, project manager, team member) and provide real-time updates and notifications.
